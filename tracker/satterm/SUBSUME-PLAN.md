# SUBSUME-PLAN — does the checker terminate on a refused row program? (`subsumeType`'s escape check)

Programme prompt: `tracker/PROMPT-subsume-termination.md` (read it first; Part B is the shared evidence).
Orchestrator: Fable (plans, briefs, merges, gates, commits, logs — never proves, implements or reviews).
Every sub-agent is Opus. Started 2026-09-16.

Base: `scala3-migration` 478a369c. Programme branch `subsume-termination`, worktree
`~/research/ermine/ermine-scala-wt-subsume`. Stage branches `subsume-<stage>` off the programme branch, one
worktree each: `~/research/ermine/ermine-scala-wt-subsume-<stage>`.

## Stages

| Stage | Branch / worktree | Agents (Opus) | Depends on | Brief | Report | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| S0 diagnosis | `subsume-s0` / `wt-subsume-s0` | implementer + reviewer | — | `briefs/brief-S0.md` | `SUBSUME-STAGE0.md`, `-REVIEW` | launched 2026-09-16 |
| S1a substitution model | `subsume-s1a` / `wt-subsume-s1a` | Lean prover + reviewer | reads S0 only | `briefs/brief-S1a.md` | `SUBSUME-STAGE1A.md`, `-REVIEW` | launched 2026-09-16 |
| S1b rejection-path model | `subsume-s1b` / `wt-subsume-s1b` | Lean prover + reviewer | reads S0 only | `briefs/brief-S1b.md` | `SUBSUME-STAGE1B.md`, `-REVIEW` | launched 2026-09-16 |
| S2 the fix | `subsume-s2` / `wt-subsume-s2` | implementer + reviewer | S0 + a reviewed S1 theorem | `briefs/brief-S2.md` | `SUBSUME-STAGE2.md`, `-REVIEW` | not started |
| S3 the budget | `subsume-s3` / `wt-subsume-s3` | implementer + reviewer (≠ S2's) | S2's PROVED negative only | `briefs/brief-S3.md` | `SUBSUME-STAGE3.md`, `-REVIEW` | not started |

Common rules for every agent: `briefs/brief-S-common.md`. Review brief: `briefs/brief-review.md`.

## Landing procedure (orchestrator)

1. Reviewer verdict LAND (or FIX-THEN-LAND with the fixes re-checked by the same reviewer).
2. Merge `subsume-termination` into the stage branch (doc conflicts: orchestrator; code conflicts: implementer).
3. Tier 0 on the merged stage tree, harness-tracked background, never `nohup`; Tier 1 items only if the review
   disputed one. Corpus verdicts must not move (89 LOADED / 79 REJECTED / 0 UNKNOWN over 168 per the prompt;
   S0 records the actual baseline on this tree).
4. One commit per stage on the stage branch citing the reviewer's verdict; fast-forward `subsume-termination`.
5. Never push, never merge into `scala3-migration`, never flip a default.

## The title question — running answer

Unanswered. Filled in per stage below (yes / no / bounded), then in the final report.

## Handoff log (append after every event; a new orchestrator resumes from here)

- 2026-09-16 (start): read PROMPT-subsume-termination.md, GATE-POLICY.md, memory notes (gate policy, autonomous
  mode, JSON Stage 3 lesson: no `nohup`). Branch `subsume-termination` created at 478a369c, worktree
  `ermine-scala-wt-subsume`. `tracker/lean` is byte-identical between 478a369c and `json-wrappers`, so the built
  `.lake` (2.0 G, mathlib v4.33.1 + Rowpartition + looptrace) from `ermine-scala-wt-json-wrappers/tracker/lean/.lake`
  is copied into the S1a/S1b worktrees to seed their builds. Machine: 12 cores, 15 G RAM (~10 G available),
  13 G disk free — three lanes concurrently are affordable, a fourth `.lake` copy is not without cleanup.
- One code-reading note recorded for the agents, NOT a finding: `Type.scala:653` `VarT(v) => v.extract.vars`
  extracts the type variable's KIND annotation (`Kind.scala:135` is the same pattern for `V[A]`), and
  `Kind.scala:65` gives `VarK(v).vars = Vars(v)` — so, as read, the kind-variable walk follows no binding at all.
  Part B's H2 wording ("follows a variable's binding") is therefore questioned in brief-S0/S1a; the agents settle it.
- 2026-09-16 ~afternoon: docs commit 1813172a on `subsume-termination`; stage branches `subsume-s0`/`s1a`/`s1b`
  and worktrees created at it; `.lake` copied into s1a and s1b (no-op `lake build` 871 jobs confirms the cache;
  disk now 8.2 G free). Three Opus agents launched concurrently: S0 implementer (3 h), S1a prover (4 h),
  S1b prover (4 h). Scratch dirs `~/research/ermine/scratch-subsume/{s0,s1a,s1b}`. Reviewers launch per stage on
  completion with `briefs/brief-review.md`. S2/S3 briefs to be written from Part C after S0/S1 report.
